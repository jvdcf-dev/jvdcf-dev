Hi! 👋  
I am a Portuguese developer ready to take new challenges and learn everything along the way.
Currently, I am in the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto (FEUP) studying in the degree of computer science and computing engineering [(L.EIC)](https://paginas.fe.up.pt/~estudar/cursos/licenciatura-engenharia-informatica/).   
**This is all to improve the world, bit by bit.**
